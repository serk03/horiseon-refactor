# HORISEON-REFACTOR

## Description

This project was provided by EDX bootcamp, which was designed to prepare me for two scanerios that i will encounter as a developer in the real world. I had to demostrate my ability to adapt to on-the-job/ feature requests and job-seeking coding assessments.

I was provided with the relevant starter code which i had to modify/ refactor and provide enhancements where needed.

Some considerations which i had to encoporate into my website when i was refactoring the code. 

- ***SEO*** - Improve the ranking and accessibility of the website so it will rank higher in search engines.
- ***Readability*** - Improve the general structure of the website and modify the code within the website so that it is easier for other developers to read and continue making further improvements if required.
- ***Semantics*** - Improve the HTML elements used within the website so it will allow accessiblity tools to effectively be able to understand the context of the website.
- ***Code Optimisation*** - Reduce the amount of repeated code within the website to make the website load faster and easier to understand for other developers. 

<br>

- **What was the motivation for this project**
  <br> 
  I wanted to improve the functionality of the website by encoporating acessibility into this website, this will allow a wider range of people the ability to view the website especially those who have impairments that may have difficulty in view website/ web pages.
  
  <br>
- **Why was this project built**
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  1. This project was built to improve the overall html semantics of the website,this will provide a better experience for users to require accessibility tools for to navigate websites.
  <br>
  2. This project was built to improve the overall SEO of the website to imrpove its ranking and accessibility within search engines.
  
<br>

- **The problems that where solved in this project**
<br>
 1. Improves the HTML semantics for screen readers to allow people who may require the use of accessibility tools to view/ listen webpages and understand the content with greater ease.<br><br>
 2. Provides better html semantics to the website also improves the seo of the site, this will make it more accessible to search engines and improves it ranking and positioning within them.


- What did you learn?<br>
  1.Within this website i learnt how to refactor a websites HTML by using semantics to help improve the functionality of the site to users.
  <br><br>
  2.Using HTML semantics to further improve the overall SEO of the website by using semantic HTML tags/ elements to help improve accessibility and ranking within search engines.
